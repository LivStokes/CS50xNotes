# CS50xNotes
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my study materials, project solutions, and weekly summaries from Harvard University's CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science.
Each week’s content is organized into dedicated sections covering lectures, shorts, sections, and problem sets, providing a structured overview of the course.

# The notes include:

- Key concepts and explanations from lectures

- Code examples and implementation insights

- Personal reflections and takeaways from each week’s material

This repository is both a personal learning archive and a reference resource for anyone interested in understanding the fundamental principles of computer science through the CS50x curriculum.
