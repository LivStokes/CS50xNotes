# Using the Linuc Command Line

ls - list of all files and folders in current directory.

cd <directory> - change directory.
cd .. - back from current directory.

pwd - present working directory.

mkdir - make directory.

cp <source> <destination> - create a duplicate of the file you specify as <source>, which it will save in <destination>.

cp –r <source directory> <destination directory> - The “-r” stands for recursive, and tells cp to dive down into the directory and copy everything inside of it (including any subdirectories it might contain).

rm <file> - removes/delete <file> after it asks you to confirm (y/n) you want to delete it.

rm –f <file> - Skip the confirmation but use at your own peril! There’s no undo.

rm –r <directory> - To delete entire directories you need to use the –r flag, just as was the case with cp.

You can also combine the –r and –f flags into –rf. Again, careful! There’s no undo!

mv <source> <destination> - move, this command will allow you to effectively rename a file, moving it from <source> to <destination>.
