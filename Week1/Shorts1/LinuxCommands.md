# Using the Linux Command Line
- ls - list of all files and folders in current directory.
- cd <directory> - change directory.
- cd .. - back from current directory.
- pwd - present working directory.
- mkdir - make directory.
- cp <source> <destination> - create a duplicate of the file you specify as <source>, which it will save in <destination>.
- cp –r <source directory> <destination directory> - The “-r” stands for recursive, and tells cp to dive down into the directory and copy everything inside of it (including any subdirectories it might contain).
- rm <file> - removes/delete <file> after it asks you to confirm (y/n) you want to delete it.
- rm –f <file> - Skip the confirmation but use at your own peril! There’s no undo.
- rm –r <directory> - To delete entire directories you need to use the –r flag, just as was the case with cp.
    - You can also combine the –r and –f flags into –rf. Again, careful! There’s no undo!
- mv <source> <destination> - move, this command will allow you to effectively rename a file, moving it from <source> to <destination>.
