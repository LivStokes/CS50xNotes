# Magic Numbers
E.g.
In mario pryramid we capped it at 23.
Why 23? Because standard height of a terminal window is 24, so we wanted to fit it into the terminal.

Bad habbit to write constants into your code. By doing so, it is reffered to as a magic number. Which we want to try and avoid.

E.G.
card deal_cards(deck name)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 52; i++)
    {
        // deal the cards
    }
}

52 is the magic number.

To resolve the problem:
card deal_cards(deck name)
{
    int deck_size = 52;
    for (int i = 0; i < deck_size; i++)
    {
        //deal the cards
    }
}

This fixes one problem but created another.
What if the deck size decreases by 1?

C provides a preprocessor directive (macro) for creating symbolic constants.
#define NAME REPLACEMENT

At the time your program is compiled, #define goes through your code and replaces NAME with REPLACEMENT.

If #include is simplar to copy/paste, then #define is analogous to find/replace.

E.g. #define PI 3.14159265
#define goes through code and reokaces PI with 3.14159265.


Best solution:
#define DECKSIZE 52

card deal_cards(deck name)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < DECKSIZE; i++)
    {
        // deal the cards.
    }
}
