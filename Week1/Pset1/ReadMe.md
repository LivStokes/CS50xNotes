# Two project submissions
## Mario-less.c
The mario-less problem set challenges the programmer to recreate the iconic right-aligned half-pyramid structure, using ASCII characters (#) and drawing inspiration from the classic Super Mario Bros. game. The solution demands rigorous input validation, requiring the program to continuously solicit an integer height from the user until a value between 1 and 8 (inclusive) is successfully provided. Once validated, the pyramid's construction must be executed using nested loops: the outer loop controls the vertical height (rows), while the inner loops handle the horizontal rendering. Specifically, the first inner loop must dynamically calculate and print the precise number of leading space characters required to push the pyramid to the right margin, and the subsequent inner loop must print the correct, incrementally increasing count of hash symbols (#) that form the solid blocks of the pyramid for the current row. This project emphasizes foundational C concepts, including loops, conditional logic, and precise character manipulation to achieve the target geometric output.

## Cash.c
The cash.c problem set requires the creation of a program that calculates the minimum number of coins necessary to make change for a customer, typically implementing a greedy algorithm. This approach dictates that the largest possible coin denomination (quarters, then dimes, nickels, and pennies) must always be used first. The process involves getting the change owed as input, converting that dollar value into an integer number of cents to ensure precise calculations, and then iteratively calculating how many of each coin can be dispensed from the remaining cents. After determining the count for one denomination, the remaining cents are updated, and the process repeats for the next smaller coin, ultimately leading to the final result: the total, smallest possible count of coins.
