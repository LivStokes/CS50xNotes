## Project
The project for this week included 2 problem sets:
1. Cash
2. Mario

### Cash
The cash project required the creation of an algorithm that calculates the minimum number of coins necessary to make change for a customer. The process involved getting the change owed as input, converting that dollar value into an integer number of cents to ensure precise calculations, and then iteratively calculating how many of each coin can be dispensed from the remaining cents. The final results should output the total smallest possible count of coins.

### Mario
The mario project involved recreating a right-aligned half-pyramid structure, using ASCII characters (#) and drawing inspiration from the classic Super Mario Bros game. The solution requires the program to continuously solicit an integer height from the user until a value between 1 and 8 is successfully provided. Once validated, the pyramid's construction must be executed using nested loops. This project emphasizes foundational C concepts, including loops, conditional logic, and precise character manipulation to achieve the target geometric output.
