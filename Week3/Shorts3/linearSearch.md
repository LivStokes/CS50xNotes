# Linear Search
Is an algorithm used to find an element in an array.
An algorithm recall is a step by step instruction to complete a task.
The linear search algorithm works as follows: 
- iterate across the array from left to right looking for a specified element.

- In pseudocode:
Repeat starting at the first element.
If the first element is what youre looking for (the target), stop.
Otherwise move to the next element.


- We can use the linear search algorithm to find targets in an array:
[11][23][8][14][30][9][6][17][22][28][25][15][7][10][19]

Target: 9

In pseudocode:
Repeat, starting at the first element.
If the frst element is what youre looking for (the target), stop.
Otherwise, move to the nex element.

11, 23. 8. 14. 30, 9!

We dont know if we didnt find a target until each element of the array has been looked at.
Only once we have done that we can then conclude if the target has been reached of not.

- Worst case scenario:
We have to look through the entire array of n elements, either because the taget element is the last element of the arrat or doesnt exist in the aray at all.

- Best case scenario:
The target element is the fist element of the array, and so we can stop looking immediatly after we start.

In the worst case we have to look in every single element, so it runs in 
- O(n) 

In the best case the element is found immediatly, so it runs in 
- Omega(1)
