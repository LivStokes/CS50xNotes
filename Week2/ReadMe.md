# Week 2
## Arrays
This week focuses on Arrays, learning about various topics including:
- Reprocessing
- Compiling
- Assembling
- Linking
- Debugging
- Arrays
- Strings
- Command-line arguments
- Cryptography

## Shorts
The shorts were focused upon topics such as:
- Arrays
- Command-line arguments
- Debugging (step through, step into)
- Functions
- Variables and scopes

## Project
This week had 3 projects:
1. Caesar
2. Readability
3. Scrabble

### Caesar
- The caesar project was to create a program that implements Caesar’s cipher: a simple substitution cipher that "rotates" each alphabetical character in a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions (the key). For example, with a key of 1, A → B, B → C, …, Z → A; thus HELLO becomes IFMMP.
- This project practiced command-line argument handling, input validation, character manipulation, and modular arithmetic in C while producing a simple, reversible encryption routine (Caesar’s cipher).

### Readability
- The readability project is about determining the reading grade level required to understand a given piece of text. The program calculates the grade level based on the Coleman–Liau index, a formula designed to estimate the complexity of English writing.
- This project demonstrates basic text analysis using C. It teaches how to count letters, words, and sentences in a string. Perform arithmetic operations and rounding with floating-point numbers. And use control structures and conditional logic to produce readable output.

### Scrabble
- The scrabble project takes a command-line argument whereby players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word. It should determine the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. 
- The program prompts the user for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores the most points, your program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!”.
