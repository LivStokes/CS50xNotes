# Doubly linked lists
- In Singly linked lists, we talked about how they do attend our ability to deal wit information where the number of elements or items in a list can grow or shink.
- They extend our ability to collect and organise data, but they siffer from a crucial limitaion:
- We can only ever move in one direction through a list.
- Consider the implication that would have for trying to delete a node.
- Doubly linked list, by contrast, allows us to mve forward and backward through te list, all by simply adding one extra pointer to our struct definition.
