# Starting from Scratch
Implement in Scratch, at scratch.mit.edu, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

## Your project must:
- use at least two sprites (2d character/ object), at least one of which must not be a cat.
- have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture.
- use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long, try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific).
- try to leverage “abstraction” where possible: if you can imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., meow), those could probably be moved to a custom block!

## Tackle one piece at a time. 
> Take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth.

> Alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won’t find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements.
