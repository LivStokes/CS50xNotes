- Unicode
- RGB
- Algorithms
- Pseudocode
- Artificial Intelligence
- Abstraction

- How to build a project in Scratch

## Project
This weeks project involves building a Scratch project where the following rules apply:
- Use at least two sprites 
- Have at least three scripts total 
- Use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Use at least one custom block that you have made yourself, which must take at least one input.
- Use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

### My Scratch Project
I designed a Scratch project which represented a Cube Jumping game. 
This game was built using various conditionals to get the player to jump using the space bar, over spikes. 
If the player hit one of the spikes, the game would restart. 
I implemented a soundtrack for the game and had sound effects for the jump and game over. 
I designed the cube, spikes, and ground levels using the Scratch design codespace.
